# Student Data Pagination and Filtering

This project demonstrates an interactive web application that utilizes **pagination** and **search functionality** to enhance user experience when navigating a list of student data. The app dynamically displays student details, including names, emails, and profile pictures, with intuitive navigation controls and search capabilities for filtering results.

## Features
- **Paginated Student Display**: Shows up to nine students per page to prevent overwhelming the user with too much information at once.
- **Dynamic Pagination Buttons**: Navigation buttons are generated automatically based on the number of students, adapting seamlessly to any list size.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for students by first or last name.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout for user interface elements.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for pagination, search functionality, and DOM manipulation.
